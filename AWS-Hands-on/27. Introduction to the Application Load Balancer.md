# **Introduction to the Application Load Balancer**

## **Description**

An Application Load Balancer functions at the application layer, the seventh layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. After the load balancer receives a request, it evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects a target from the target group for the rule action. Although the Network Load Balancer is faster, the Application Load Balancer offers the greatest number of features due to its ability to make decisions based on the Application Layer (layer 7 of the OSI model), and supports content-based routing, container support, and application monitoring. This allows your Application Load Balancer to route traffic more intelligently between your instances.

In this lab exercise, you will create an Application Load Balancer and a Target Group, which will be attached to an existing Auto Scaling Group. This will prepare you to deploy your own ALBs within your applications at layer 7.
