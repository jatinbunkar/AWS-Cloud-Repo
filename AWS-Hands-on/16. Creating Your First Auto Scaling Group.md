# Creating Your First Auto Scaling Group

### Description
A limited number of servers to cope with the application load can result in various failures and latency issues when
the number of requests rises. The AWS Auto Scaling service automatically increases or decreases the Amazon
EC2 compute capacity allocated for the cloud application, in response to changes in demand. Thus, it makes
resources highly available which in turn eliminates various failure issues related to the increased load on limited
servers.


The objective of this lab is to create an Auto Scaling Group and to ensure the availability of optimum number of
functional instances.

- Launch an Amazon Linux 2 image for this lab session.
- Under IP Address Type, select ‘Assign a public IP Address to every instance’
- Assign a new Security Group (SG) OR New SG and provide a name and description for this SG.
- Click Create launch Configuration.
- Update required Details and click on Create Auto Scaling group using this launch configuration.


2. Create an Auto Scaling Group:
- Go to EC2 console and click on Auto Scaling Groups under AUTO SCALING in the left navigation pane.
- Click on Create Auto Scaling Group

- Select Create an Auto Scaling group from an existing launch-configuration and choose the launch configuration that is created.
- Provide name to the Auto Scaling Group, group size (keep the size as 1), and subnets to use inside the default VPC.

- Skip configuring the Advanced Details.
- Select Keep this group at its initial size under Configure scaling policies.
- Select the type of notifications by creating an SNS Topic under Add notification.

- Skip configuring tags and click Create Auto Scaling Group button. Auto Scaling Group is created and wait for the status to be up and running.

3. Test ASG behaviour during failures:
- Open Auto Scaling Group just created.
- Select the running instance and terminate it to see that the Auto Scaling Group is up and running.

Auto Scaling Group creates a new instance with same configuration on terminating the existing one.
