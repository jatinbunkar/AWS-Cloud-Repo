# Creating Your First Auto Scaling Group

### Description
A limited number of servers to cope with the application load can result in various failures and latency issues when
the number of requests rises. The AWS Auto Scaling service automatically increases or decreases the Amazon
EC2 compute capacity allocated for the cloud application, in response to changes in demand. Thus, it makes
resources highly available which in turn eliminates various failure issues related to the increased load on limited
servers.
