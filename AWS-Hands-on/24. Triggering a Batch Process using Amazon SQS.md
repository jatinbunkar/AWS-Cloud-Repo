# Triggering a Batch Process using Amazon SQS

## Description

Most of the Batch Processes on AWS can be handled using AWS Batch. This is an alternative to the AWS Batch Service. In order to organize the huge number of processes, a Queue is used to streamline the flow of processes
for better consumption. In this lab exercise, one such process (uploading a file to S3) is processed by Lambda via SQS.
