# Triggering a Batch Process using Amazon SQS

## Description

Most of the Batch Processes on AWS can be handled using AWS Batch. This is an alternative to the AWS Batch Service. In order to organize the huge number of processes, a Queue is used to streamline the flow of processes
for better consumption. In this lab exercise, one such process (uploading a file to S3) is processed by Lambda via SQS.

### **Objective**
Create a batch processing system where a file uploaded to an S3 bucket sends a message to an SQS queue, which is then processed by a Lambda function.

### **Steps to Implement**

### 1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
- Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the **S3** service.
- Click on **Create bucket**.
- Provide a **unique name** for the bucket and choose a region.
- Keep other settings as default or adjust as needed.
- Click **Create bucket**.

### 2. **Create an SQS Queue**
- Go to the **Amazon SQS** service in the AWS Console.
- Click on **Create queue**.
- Choose **Standard queue**.
- Enter a name for the queue.
- Configure other settings if needed and click **Create queue**.

### 3. **Edit the Access Policy of SQS Queue**
- Go to your created SQS queue and select it.
- Click on the **Permissions** tab.
- Choose **Edit** under the Access Policy section.
- Copy and paste the following policy, replacing `<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>`, `<AWS-ACCOUNT-ID>`, and `<region>`:


```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "PolicyForS3ToSQS",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowS3ToSendMessage",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:<region>:<AWS-ACCOUNT-ID>:<Queue-Name>",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

### 4. **Configure S3 Event Notification**
-  Navigate to your S3 bucket.
-  Go to the Properties tab.
-  Scroll to Event notifications and click Create event notification.
-  Fill in the following details:
    -  Name: Provide a name for the event.
    -  Event types: Select All object create events.
    -  Destination: Choose SQS Queue and enter the ARN of your SQS queue.
    -  Click Save.

### 5. **Upload an Object to S3**
-  Go to the S3 bucket.
-  Click Upload and add a file.
-  Click Upload to confirm.
-  Check the SQS queue to verify a message has been received.

### 6. **Create a Lambda Function**
-  Navigate to the AWS Lambda service.
-  Click on Create function.
-  Choose Author from scratch and fill in:
    -  Function name: Provide a name.
    -  Runtime: Select Python 3.8.
    -  Role: Choose Use an existing role and select CCL-Lambda-Role.
 
IAM ROLE:

-  **AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole**

```yaml
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
                "sqs:DeleteMessage",
                "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```


-  Click Create function.

        print(f"Received message: {message}")
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Message processed successfully')
    }

```
