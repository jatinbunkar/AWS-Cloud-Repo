# Introduction to AWS Lambda

### Description
AWS Lambda is Amazon’s most reliable serverless AWS Compute service. Being serverless doesn’t mean that servers are nowhere in the play. Instead, it means that users don’t have to worry about provisioning or maintaining servers. AWS Lambda automatically provides us whatever resources required to run code to react to events. Users pay only for the compute time they consume and there is no charge when code is not running.
AWS Lambda can be used for varied tasks including image processing, log processing, and security automation.
The objective of this lab is to:
- understand and create Lambda functions using AWS Console
- test Lambda functions created
