# Creating Amazon S3 Bucket using CloudFormation

### Description:

Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any
time, from anywhere on the web. We will have buckets to store the information that can be either file/text/image etc.
You can store virtually any kind of data in any format. An Amazon S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the
namespace is shared by all AWS accounts. After uploading we can have public access or can change it and enable
versioning as well. In this lab exercise, we will use CloudFormation to create buckets.

### Steps:

1. Open the **CloudFormation** in the console which helps us in creating the resources.

2. **Click on "Create Stack"**, select the **"Template is ready"** option, and then click on **"Upload a template file"**. Upload the YAML S3 template as follows:

   ```yaml
   AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
   Resources:
     S3Bucket:
       Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
       DeletionPolicy: Retain
       Properties:
         BucketName: jatinbucket2704

3. Specify a **name** for the stack leave the rest of the settings to their default values and create the stack.

4.  Once the stack creation is complete, navigate to S3 and find the bucket that was created by
CloudFormation.
