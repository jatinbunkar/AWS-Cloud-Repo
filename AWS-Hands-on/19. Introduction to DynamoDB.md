# Introduction to DynamoDB

### Description
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed non-relational (NoSQL) database solution that provides fast performance at
any scale.
With Amazon DynamoDB, developers scaling cloud-based applications can start small with just the capacity they
need and then increase the request capacity of a given table as their app grows in popularity. It stores data on Solid
State Drives (SSDs) and replicates it synchronously across multiple AWS Availability Zones in an AWS Region to
provide built-in high availability and data durability.
The objective of this lab is to:
- create and configure DynamoDB tables
- add and edit rows in DynamoDB tables
- query information in DynamoDB
