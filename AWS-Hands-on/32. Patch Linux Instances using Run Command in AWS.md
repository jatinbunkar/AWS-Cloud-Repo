# **Patch Linux Instances using Run Command in AWS**

## **Description**

In this hands-on lab, you will solve a real-world scenario where we will patch our Linux servers using the **Run Command** feature in AWS Systems Manager Service.  
**Run Command** enables you to automate common administrative tasks and perform ad hoc configuration changes at scale.

## **Lab Steps**

Follow the steps outlined below to achieve the objective of this lab exercise.

### **Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance**
1. Log in to the AWS Console and navigate to the **EC2** service.
2. In the EC2 dashboard, click on **Launch Instance**.
3. In **Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**, select **Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)**.
4. In **Step 2: Choose Instance Type**, select **t2.micro**, and click **Next**.
5. In **Step 3: Configure Instance Details**, under **IAM Role**, choose **EC2-Role**, and click **Review and Launch**.
6. (Optional) Create a key pair if you plan to SSH into your instance via PuTTY. If you prefer using the **Session Manager** service, choose the option **Proceed without a key pair**.

### **Step 2: Ensure the Instance is Running**
7. In the **Instances Dashboard**, confirm that your instance is in a **running** state.



### **Step 3: Create an S3 Bucket**
8. Navigate to the **S3** service.
9. Create a new bucket, ensuring that it adheres to the S3 bucket naming rules.

### **Step 6: Select Targets**
14. Under the **Targets** section, choose how to select instances:
    - For this lab, select **Choose instances manually** and select the instance you created earlier.
    - In real-world scenarios, you may have a greater number of instances categorized under tags (e.g., dev, prod) or resource groups. Use those options for more efficient targeting.

### **Step 7: Enable Output Logging**
15. Under **Output Options**, check the option **Enable writing to an S3 Bucket**, then select the S3 bucket you created in Step 3.

### **Step 8: Run the Command**
16. Click **Run** to execute the command.  
    - Monitor the command status until it changes to **Success**.
