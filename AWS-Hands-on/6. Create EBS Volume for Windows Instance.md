# Create EBS Volume for Windows Instance

## Important

Before extending a file system that contains valuable data, it is a best practice to create a snapshot of the volume that contains it in case you need to roll back your changes.</span> For more information, see [Create Amazon EBS snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html).


## Steps:

1. **Create an EC2 instance.**
   We created.

```
i-0909931218ddb8b44 (jatin_windows)
```

When we login to this instance there will be only 1 drive.

### PowerShell Command to Get Volume ID

The `get-disk` command is used to retrieve information about disks, including their volume IDs, in PowerShell.

```PowerShell
Get-Disk
```

Now we have 2 EBS Volumes attached to the instance.

As we can see 10 GB Volume is not allocated.
