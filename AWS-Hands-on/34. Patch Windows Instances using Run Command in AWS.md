# **Patch Windows Instances using Run Command in AWS**

## **Description**


In this hands-on lab, you will solve a real-world scenario where we will patch our Windows servers using the **Run Command** feature in AWS Systems Manager Service.  
**Run Command** enables you to automate common administrative tasks and perform ad hoc configuration changes at scale.
