# Create Your First Amazon S3 Bucket


### Description

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is web-based cloud storage service. With Amazon S3, a user can
store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web, as it is designed for large-capacity,
low-cost storage provision across multiple geographical regions.
S3 has two primary entities called buckets and objects. Objects are stored inside buckets. Bucket names must be
globally unique irrespective of which region they are created in.
