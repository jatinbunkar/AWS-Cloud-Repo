# Create Your First Amazon S3 Bucket


### Description

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is web-based cloud storage service. With Amazon S3, a user can
store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web, as it is designed for large-capacity,
low-cost storage provision across multiple geographical regions.
S3 has two primary entities called buckets and objects. Objects are stored inside buckets. Bucket names must be
globally unique irrespective of which region they are created in.

### Lab Steps:

Follow the steps outlined below to achieve the objective of this lab exercise:

1. Create a bucket.

</p>
  

3. Create a folder.
4. Upload files to the bucket. Now, if the user tries to access the object using Object URL, it displays Permission
Denied.
5. Hence, we are making the object public by:
- Under Permissions tab, uncheck the ‘Block all Public Access’ option
- Under Permissions tab, go to either Access Control List (ACL) or Bucket Policy (JSON script)
- As part of this lab, we use ACL by setting everyone option under public access.

5. After making the bucket pubic, the user is able to access the objects through:
https://<bucket>.s3.amazonaws.com/<file>
6. Set metadata for S3 bucket when uploading an object into S3 bucket. User can add metadata under Set
Properties section – OR-
7. After uploading the object, under Properties section, the user can add/delete/edit the metadata
8. Delete the associated objects (folders and files) stored in the bucket and then delete the S3 bucket.
