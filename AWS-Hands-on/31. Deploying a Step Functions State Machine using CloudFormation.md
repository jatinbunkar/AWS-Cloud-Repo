# Deploying a Step Functions State Machine using CloudFormation

## 1.1 Description
In this use case, we will deploy a CloudFormation stack that creates a Step Functions state machine. This state machine will use a Lambda function as a state, and when the state machine is executed, it will return the current DateTime.

## 1.3 Lab Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to CloudFormation Console
- Go to the **AWS CloudFormation Console** to create a new stack.

### Step 2: Create a New Stack
- Click on **Create Stack**.
- Select **Template is ready** option and click on **Upload a template file**.
- Save the CloudFormation template provided below and upload it to CloudFormation.
- Click **Next**.

### Step 3: Provide Stack Details
- Name the stack (e.g., `StepFunctionsStateMachineStack`).
- Leave all other settings as default.
- Do not select any IAM roles for the CloudFormation stack.
- Click **Next**.

### Step 4: Review and Create Stack
- Review the stack settings and click on **Create** to launch the stack.
- CloudFormation will now create the resources including the Step Functions state machine and Lambda function.

### Step 5: Check Created Resources
- Once the stack creation is complete, navigate to the **Resources** tab (next to **Events**).
- Here, you will find the two resources that were created by the stack: the Lambda function and the State Machine.
- Click on the physical IDs of these resources to inspect them further.

### Step 6: Access the State Machine
- Click on the **StateMachine**â€™s physical ID, which will take you to the newly created state machine in the **Step Functions Console**.
- On the State Machine page, click on **Start Execution** to test the state machine.
- Leave the input as default and click on **Start Execution** again.

### Step 7: Verify Execution
- Once the execution status shows as **Succeeded**, expand the **Output** section to view the result.
- The output will show the current DateTime returned by the Lambda function.

### Step 8: Modify the State Machine (Optional)
- You can modify the state machine by adding more states and integrating additional tasks such as invoking different Lambda functions or performing other AWS services' actions.
