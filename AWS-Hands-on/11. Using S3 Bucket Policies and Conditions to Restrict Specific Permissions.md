# Using S3 Bucket Policies and Conditions to Restrict Specific Permissions

### Description

Anonymous users and accounts are restricted by default from accessing S3 unless they are given access through
Simple Storage Serviceâ€™s (S3) bucket policy. Bucket policies are based around the use of JSON (JavaScript Object
Notation) files. AWS makes it relatively easy to set basic permissions on its S3 buckets through the AWS Policy
Generator that presents with a Policy JSON Document that user can copy and paste to achieve this lab exercise.
The objective of this lab is to create a bucket policy to restrict specific IP address and to deny any uploaded object
that does not have server-side encryption.
