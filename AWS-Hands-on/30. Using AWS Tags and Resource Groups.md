# **Using AWS Tags and Resource Groups**

## **Description**
To simplify the management of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Resources such as EC2 Instances, tags are
assigned. These tags can be used by resource groups to automate tasks on large numbers of resources at one
time. They serve as a unique identifier for custom automation, to break out cost reporting by department and much
more. In this SOP, Tag Editor and AWS Resource Group basics are discussed and see how to leverage automation
through the use of tags.
