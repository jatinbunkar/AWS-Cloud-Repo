# Getting Started with CloudFormation

### Description

AWS CloudFormation provides user a simple way to create and manage resources or collection of resources on
Amazon Web Services. It allows you to manage your complete infrastructure or AWS resources using a template,
you just need to describe all the resources that you want to create and AWS CloudFormation takes care of
provisioning and configuring those resources.

### Architecture Diagram
The diagram below displays a visual representation of the application architecture:

### Steps:

1.  Sign in to AWS Management Console
- Open a browser and go to the AWS Management Console.
- Sign in with your credentials (IAM user or root account).

2. Navigate to CloudFormation
- In the AWS Management Console, search for CloudFormation in the search bar and select it.
- This will open the AWS CloudFormation dashboard, where you can manage stacks (collections of AWS resources).

3. Create a CloudFormation Stack
- Click the Create Stack button and select With new resources (standard).
- In the Specify template section, you can choose to:
- Upload a template file: If you have a template file on your local machine (YAML or JSON format), upload it.
- Amazon S3 URL: If the template is stored in an S3 bucket, provide the URL.
- Use a sample template: AWS provides pre-built sample templates you can use for testing and learning.

4. Upload or Select a Template
- If you're using your own template, click on Upload a template file, and browse for the YAML/JSON file.
- If you’re following a sample template, click Choose sample template and select a basic example, such as an EC2 instance or an S3 bucket.


**Example template snippet for an EC2 instance:**

```yaml
Copy code
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      KeyName: MyKeyPair  # Ensure this KeyPair exists in your region
      SecurityGroups: 
        - default
```

- Click Next to proceed.

5. Configure Stack Details

- Enter a Stack Name (e.g., MyFirstStack).
- If your template has parameters (e.g., EC2 instance type, AMI, key pair), you'll need to enter those values here.
- Click Next.

6. Configure Stack Options (Optional)
- You can specify additional options such as:
- Tags (key-value pairs to identify your resources)
- Permissions (IAM roles for the CloudFormation stack)
- Rollback configuration
- Stack policies
- These are optional, so you can leave them as default.
- Click Next.
