# **Import JSON into DynamoDB**

## Description
In this lab exercise, we will create an EC2 instance and by using AWS CLI in instance, we will create and interact
with DynamoDB table by using the JSON files as schema and input as well.

## Architecture Diagram
The diagram below displays a visual representation of the application architecture:

## Lab Steps

Follow the steps outlined below to achieve the objective of this lab exercise:
1. Navigate to the EC2 service in AWS console.
2. Create an Amazon Linux 2 instance with type as t2.micro and attach the required role. (Below Policy are required to work with Dynamodb)

```json
"dynamodb:CreateTable",
"dynamodb:DescribeTable",
"dynamodb:DeleteTable",
"dynamodb:PutItem",
"dynamodb:Scan"
```

3. Save the Key Pair and SSH into the instance using the key pair or the Session Manager.

4. Update the instance using the following command:

        sudo yum update -y

5. Use the below command to create a json file which we will use as a schema for creating the table.

        sudo nano tableschema.json

6. Copy and paste the below content there and replace <TABLE_NAME> with your preferred table name.

```json
{
  "AttributeDefinitions": [
    {
      "AttributeName": "Artist",
      "AttributeType": "S"
    },
    {
      "AttributeName": "SongTitle",
      "AttributeType": "S"
    }
  ],
  "TableName": "YourTableName", 
  "KeySchema": [
    {
      "AttributeName": "Artist",
      "KeyType": "HASH"
    },
    {
      "AttributeName": "SongTitle",
      "KeyType": "RANGE"
    }
  ],
  "ProvisionedThroughput": {
    "ReadCapacityUnits": 5,
    "WriteCapacityUnits": 5
  }
}

7. Once it is in nano, you can close out by typing CTRL+X and when it requires you to save, press the Y key.
8. It prompts for the file name, and it should already be populated when you opened nano. Press the
enter/return key.
9. Use the following command to create the table.

        aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file://tableschema.json --region us-east-2

- To Check Status
-         aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name JatinTable --region us-east-2

10. Use the following command to create a json file which we will use as a schema for creating the table.

        sudo nano items.json

11. Copy and paste the following content:

```json
{
  "Artist": { "S": "Arijit Singh" },
  "SongTitle": { "S": "Aayat" }
}
    
```

12. Once it is in nano, you can close out by typing CTRL+X and when it requires you to save, press the Y key.
