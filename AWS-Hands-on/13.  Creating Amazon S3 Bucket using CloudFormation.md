# Creating Amazon S3 Bucket using CloudFormation

### Description

Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any
time, from anywhere on the web. We will have buckets to store the information that can be either file/text/image etc.
You can store virtually any kind of data in any format. An Amazon S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the
namespace is shared by all AWS accounts. After uploading we can have public access or can change it and enable
versioning as well. In this lab exercise, we will use CloudFormation to create buckets.
