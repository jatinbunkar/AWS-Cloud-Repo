# Introduction to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

### Description
AWS Virtual Private Cloud is an Amazon service that allows you to create your own virtual networking environment
within AWS cloud where you can launch Amazon resources. You can completely control your virtual data center in
the AWS cloud, including a selection of your own private IP address range, creation of subnets and configuration of
route tables and network gateways.


*The objective of this lab is to:*
- create a VPC
- create resources (subnet and internet gateway) that work with Amazon VPC
- configure routing for your VPC using a route table
- create and manage an EC2 instance within your VPC

Note: View the Summary tab and confirm the below options created. Neither Subnets nor Internet
Gateways were automatically created with the VPC.

</p>


4. On the Left side panel, select Internet gateway > select create internet gateway



5. Create a VPC Internet Gateway by specifying the name for the gateway.
- Select the Gateway created, and then click Actions > Attach to VPC. The new Internet Gateway is attached and available to be used by EC2 instances of the attached VPC.

</p>


- Select the Main route table for the VPC and edit the routes
- add another route and enter 0.0.0.0/0 as the Destination
- Select the Internet Gateway created previously in the Target field and save routes.
